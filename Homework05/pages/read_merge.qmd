## Running Code

Load libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Read the math dataset from local CSV file

Read the Portuguese dataset from local CSV file

```{r}

math_data <- read_delim("../student/student-mat.csv", delim = ";", show_col_types = FALSE)
por_data  <- read_delim("../student/student-por.csv", delim = ";", show_col_types = FALSE)


```

Exclude grade and absence columns before joining

Get list of common columns to join on

```{r}
exclude   <- c("G1","G2","G3","paid","absences")
join_keys <- setdiff(names(math_data), exclude)


```

Combine both datasets using inner join on common columns

```{r}
combine_data <- inner_join(math_data, por_data,
                           by = join_keys,
                           relationship = "many-to-many")

```

Show first few rows of the combined dataset

```{r}
head(combine_data)
print(paste("Rows in combined dataset:", nrow(combine_data)))
```
